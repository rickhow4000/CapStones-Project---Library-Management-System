# CapStones-Project---Library-Management-System
Library Management System (LMS)
A full-stack web application for managing a community library’s printed materials and lending operations. MVP supports two user roles: Member and Librarian.

This project fulfills the NTUC Learning Hub Fullstack Development SCTP Capstone Project requirement.
Note: Deployment is not required for this submission.

Objectives
Develop a functional web application using Spring Boot, React.js, and MySQL.
Demonstrate knowledge of:
Java & Spring Boot (MVC architecture)
ReactJS & modern frontend development
Database design & CRUD operations
Software design, architecture, and testing
Showcase transferrable skills from project management and engineering experience.
Tech Stack
Frontend

React.js for responsive browser behavior
Axios for API communication
react-router-dom for routing & guarded routes
Backend

Java 17+
Spring Boot & Spring Security (BCrypt for authentication)
RESTful APIs (JWT-based auth)
Database

MySQL Server for data persistence
Other Tools

Git & GitHub for version control
Postman for API testing
Architecture & Design
The application follows MVC architecture:

View

React components and pages managed via react-router-dom
PrivateRoute ensures access based on Member or Librarian role
Communicates with backend via REST API calls (Axios)
Model

JPA Entities & Spring Data JPA Repositories
Data validation and business-rule enforcement
Controller / Service

Spring Boot REST Controllers map HTTP requests
Service layer encapsulates business logic and coordinates persistence
JSON responses returned to the frontend
Security (Defense-in-Depth)

Client-side: Route guarding via PrivateRoute to prevent navigation to protected pages
Server-side: Method/endpoint authorization (e.g., @PreAuthorize), JWT validation, and input validation/sanitization
Sensitive actions are protected by client-side route guarding (PrivateRoute) and server-side authorization (@PreAuthorize), plus input validation to remain secure even if the frontend is bypassed.

Features Overview
Member
Sign up / Log in
Search books by title, author, or ISBN
View book details and availability
Borrow, renew (max 2), return, and reserve books
View own loan history and fines
On-screen notifications for due dates, overdue books, and reservation availability
Librarian
All Member functions
Add, edit, and remove (archive) books
Manage loans, renewals, and returns
Manage categories/material types
View and manage reservation queues
Navigation & Access Control (RBAC)
Role	Pages / Components Access
Member	Search Books, Book Details, Borrow/Renew/Return, Reserve, My Loans/History, My Fines, Profile
Librarian	All Member pages + Administer Books (Add/Edit/Archive), Manage Loans/Returns/Renewals, Reservations
RBAC enforced in React routes (client) and Spring Security (server).
Sensitive mutations are always re-checked server-side.
Authentication Flow
User submits login form in React.
React POSTs to /api/auth/login with credentials.
Backend validates credentials (BCrypt) and issues a JWT with role claims.
React stores the JWT (e.g., localStorage) and uses it in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
PrivateRoute reads role claims to guard routes.
Spring Security validates JWT and authorizes protected endpoints.
Project Plan & Milestones (Instructor)
Total project duration: 40 hours

Milestone 1: Project Setup (4 hrs)
Initialize Spring Boot & React projects, set up MySQL, basic docs.

Milestone 2: User Registration & Authentication (6 hrs)
Auth endpoints, registration/login flows, frontend forms, documentation updates.

Milestone 3: Book Management (Admin) (8 hrs)
Note: “Admin” maps to Librarian in this MVP.
CRUD endpoints, Librarian dashboard/UI, update ERD & API docs.

Milestone 4: Book Search & Borrow/Return (10 hrs)
Search (backend + frontend), borrow/return endpoints & UI, real-time availability updates.

Milestone 5: Overdue Notifications (4 hrs)
Scheduled checks for overdue loans; UI notifications.

Milestone 6: Integration, Testing & Final Documentation (8 hrs)
Integrate frontend-backend, testing (unit/integration), finalize documentation, presentation prep.

Deliverables (Instructor / Training Provider)
Running Application
A fully functional LMS demonstrating all core functionalities.

(Optional) GitHub Repository
Source code, versioned and documented.

Documentation
BRD and SRS
System Design Document (architecture, database/ERD, API, UI mock-ups)
Test Plan and sample Test Cases
User Manual
Basic usage guide for Members and Librarians
Developer Documentation (optional)
Setup, run scripts, environment notes, and coding conventions
Resources & Methodology
Solo development (Victor): GitHub, Postman, MySQL Workbench, Eclipse/VS Code.
Hybrid approach: upfront design (DB, API), then iterative feature development and testing aligned to the milestones.
Testing: JUnit (backend), Jest/RTL (frontend), Postman collections for endpoints.
